# TODO: Implement Dark Mode Theme for GroupMate(G-M8) App

## Overview
Transform the entire app to a professional dark mode theme inspired by Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, and Zoom. This includes dark backgrounds, suitable colors for dark mode, and advanced design elements like subtle shadows, rounded corners, and improved contrast.

## Key Changes
- **Global Theme**: Switch to dark backgrounds (#1e1e1e or #121212), light text (#ffffff or #e0e0e0), and dark cards (#2d2d2d).
- **Accent Colors**: Retain blues (#1e40af) but ensure high contrast on dark backgrounds.
- **Professional Design**: Enhance shadows, borders, and spacing for a polished look.
- **Consistency**: Apply dark mode to all pages (Landing, Auth, Home, etc.).

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Update global body and layout backgrounds to dark.
- [x] Modify auth cards, modals, and forms for dark backgrounds and light text.
- [x] Adjust home layout, sidebar, topbar, and playground to dark theme.
- [x] Update landing page to dark mode (navbar, hero, features, etc.).
- [x] Ensure all buttons, inputs, and interactive elements have proper contrast.
- [x] Test and refine shadows, borders, and hover effects for advanced feel.
- [x] Verify responsiveness and accessibility in dark mode.

## Dependent Files
- `client/src/styles/global.css`: Main file for all styles.

## Followup Steps
- Test the app in browser for visual consistency.
- Adjust any color values if needed for better readability.
- Consider adding a theme toggle if required in future.
